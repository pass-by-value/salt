:depends:
  - Postgresql databse
  - Python postgresql driver
  - Salt's pgjsonb queue module

Installation
------------

- Install postgresql database.
- Install the python postgresql driver and configure the pgjsonb queue
  as shown in :ref:`setup <salt-returners.pgjsonb>`.

Introduction
------------


Clients (like the CLI and the Salt API)
can be used to submit jobs to Salt.
As an example we could use the ``salt-run`` command
to get a list of all the jobs in the cache.

  .. code-block:: bash

      salt-run jobs.list_jobs

The request submitted above is executed by Salt
immediately (assuming there are
enough worker threads).

There are, however cases when Salt
might have idle workers,
but some other underlying
resources (perhaps out of Saltâ€™s control)
might be unavailable.
One example is when we are interfacing with a chassis
and all available blades
are already in use. In this case users want
Salt to queue up this request and execute the job
as resources become available.
Further, users also want the ability to impose
an upper limit on the number of jobs
running at any given point in time.
It may be noted that we do not
necessarily need to impose this limit on all jobs (just a subset).

This module adds a queue based mechanism
for tracking requests
and imposing upper limits
on the number of jobs
of a given (arbitrary) type
that can be running in the system
at any given point in time.

This queue based mechanism is backed
by postgresql to hold json data structures.
Postgresql interface is via salt's pgjsonb
queue module.

Queue Definition
----------------

Queues can be defined in the Salt master
config file

  .. code-block:: yaml

      input_queues:
        - name: salt_queue
          capacity: 2
        - name: testing
          capacity: 16


Submitting a salt run job to the queue
--------------------------------------

Jobs can be submitted to a queue using the ``salt-run``
command

  .. code-block:: yaml

      $ salt-run jobs.list_jobs --queue salt_queue
      # returns with a request id
      $ request_id = 20170123104403777773

In this case the ``jobs.list_jobs`` that we submitted doesn't
execute immediately. It is submitted to the queue named ``salt_queue``.
This module takes care of making sure that the submitted request
is executed by Salt. As mentioned above we make sure that there
are no more than ``capacity`` number of jobs
running at any given point in time. In the above case, multiple
users (say 10) could submit salt-run jobs to this queue at the same time.
But at any given point in time there will only be at most 2 jobs running.


Checking for job completion
---------------------------

At this time this module checks the event bus to
determine when a job completes.
Users can also watch the salt event bus to check the
status of their jobs.


Loop interval setting
---------------------

The frequency with which this module submits
pending jobs for execution and tracks completion
status is the same as ``loop_interval``
(which can be set in the salt master config file).
This can be varied as per your requirement.
